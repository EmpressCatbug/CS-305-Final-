This repository is part of the CS 305 course portfolio, featuring artifacts from my work with Artemis Financial. It showcases my ability to conduct thorough security assessments and implement secure coding practices, crucial for safeguarding client data and ensuring software reliability.




**CS 305 Project One: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment**


### Overview of Artemis Financial

Artemis Financial specializes in handling sensitive financial data, requiring stringent security measures to protect client information during transactions and communications. This report delves into various security aspects tailored to their needs, such as encryption protocols, compliance with international data protection laws, and defenses against external threats.

### Contents of the Repository

- **Vulnerability Assessment Report**: A detailed document identifying security vulnerabilities within Artemis Financial's software system and recommending steps for mitigation.
- **Supporting Materials**: Includes screenshots and additional documents used to support the findings and recommendations in the report.

### Reflections and Key Insights

1. **Client Summary**: Artemis Financial, a firm that necessitates high-security measures for protecting financial data. They required a robust assessment to enhance their software security against modern threats.
2. **Successful Practices**: My effective identification of security vulnerabilities like SQL injection risks and hardcoded credentials showcases the critical importance of secure coding practices, adding significant value to the companyâ€™s operational security.
3. **Challenges Encountered**: The manual review exposed a lack of input validation and error handling which was particularly challenging given the complex nature of the financial data involved.
4. **Security Enhancements Implemented**: Increased layers of security by recommending stringent input validation, use of secure coding practices, and regular updates to vulnerable libraries.
5. **Verification of Security Measures**: Post-refactoring, I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Continuous integration tools were recommended to maintain ongoing security assurance.
6. **Resources and Tools Utilized**: Leveraged OWASP guidelines, secure coding practices from sources like Oracle, and various automated testing tools to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential security issues.
7. **Professional Showcase**: This project effectively demonstrates my skills in conducting detailed security assessments and developing actionable mitigation strategies, which I can present to future employers to exhibit my expertise in secure software development.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Review the Report**: Navigate through the `Vulnerability Assessment Report` to understand the detailed analysis and recommendations made.
2. **Examine Supporting Materials**: Refer to the additional documents and screenshots provided for a deeper insight into the practical application of security practices.

### Conclusion

This repository not only serves as a testament to my technical ability to address and mitigate software vulnerabilities but also highlights my analytical approach in securing software applications in compliance with industry standards.
